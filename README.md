This script reads in two sation/elevation profiles from an excel file, interpolates them to a common station spacing, and then combines them into a single profile.
It then filters the combined profile to only include rows where the elevation changes by more than 0.02 ft from the previous row.

The image below illustrates how a SA/2d weird rofile in RAS (RAS Spillway) and an unpdated rating created from another source (Restore Spillway) were combined to create a Mashed Rating Curve (Combined Max).
